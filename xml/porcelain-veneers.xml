	<p>Many busy adults make a lot of sacrifices for others, such as for family, work or friends. You deserve to treat yourself well, no matter how busy you may be. Porcelain veneers are an impressive procedure that boosts your overall look and smile. Porcelain veneers can correct chipped, cracked, discolored or misaligned teeth, poor bondings, old fillings, or oddly-shaped gums. Dr. Richard Dervin can indulge you and your smile with dental elegance.</p>

<p>We can make imperfections vanish beneath custom-matched porcelain veneers that offer decades of classic beauty and durable strength.</p>
<ul>
    <li>LVI-level expertise — multiple specialties in many disciplines, from hygiene to neuromuscular science</li>
    <li>World-class materials — Empress® and Zirconia® materials crafted by an LVI-accredited master ceramist</li>
    <li>Experienced techniques — every detail must be clean, safe and technically sound<li>
    <li>Meticulous precision — every step is carefully orchestrated</li>
    <li>Consistent focus — on your needs, wants, expectations, concerns, fears, hopes and dreams</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on your unique situation, we offer three types of veneers: no-prep veneers, Empress® lab-fabricated (the most beautiful and natural porcelain) and same-day composite laminates. When the procedure is done and you first peer into the mirror, you’ll see your own beautiful, natural, functional and durable smile.</p>]]></text>
