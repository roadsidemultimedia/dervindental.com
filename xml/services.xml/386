	<p><strong>Receding Gums Recaptured with Pinhole Surgical Technique</strong></p>
<p>
  Gum recession occurs gradually and may go unnoticed until you start to experience tooth sensitivity, or perhaps notice a tooth that looks longer than normal. Often a notch can be felt near the gum line. This is not something to ignore! <br>
  When gums recede, the root structure of the tooth becomes exposed to harmful bacteria and can decay. The beauty of your smile can also be compromised by this condition.</p>
<strong>Why Do Gums Recede?</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Periodontal diseases are bacterial gum infections that destroy gum tissue and supporting bone.</li>
  <li>Genetics can predispose you to gum degeneration.</li>
  <li>Aggressive tooth brushing can damage delicate gum tissue.</li>
  <li>Hormonal fluctuations in a woman’s life—such as in puberty, pregnancy, and menopause—can make gums more sensitive and vulnerable to gum recession.</li>
  <li>Tobacco use creates a sticky plaque on teeth that’s difficult to remove and can lead to receding gums.</li>
  <li>A misaligned bite or grinding/clenching of teeth can put too much force on gums and teeth, causing them to recede.</li>
  <li>Lip or tongue jewelry can rub the gums and irritate them until that gum tissue actually wears away.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Since healthy gums are essential for a healthy mouth and smile, treating gum recession is important for lasting dental wellness.<br>
  </p>
<p>
<strong>Incision and Suture-Free Treatment!</strong><br>
  Traditional treatment for gum recession involves harvesting soft tissue from another site and meticulously suturing it in place to slowly rebuild the gum-line. Is there a less invasive, more efficient treatment available?<br>
  Yes! Dr. Dervin has received specialized training in order to offer the revolutionary Pinhole Surgical Technique in Shawnee, as founded by the much celebrated Dr. John Chao. <br>
  <br>
  Dr. Dervin performs this procedure by inserting small dental instruments, designed by Dr. Chao, into a tiny entry point to loosen soft gum tissues and slide them back into a normal, healthy position.  Then tiny collagen strips are placed through the entry point under the gums to keep the gums in place during the healing process. </p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Pinhole Surgical Technique</strong><br>

  Since there’s no incision or suturing, the ground-breaking treatment takes a fraction of the time of the traditional methods.  Patients can expect minimal post-operative symptoms (pain, swelling and bleeding), and an instant cosmetic improvement! Make your appointment today!</p>
